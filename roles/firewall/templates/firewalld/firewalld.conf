# firewalld config file

# default zone
# The default zone used if an empty zone string is used.
# Default: public
DefaultZone=public

# Clean up on exit
# If set to no or false the firewall configuration will not get cleaned up
# on exit or stop of firewalld
# Default: yes
CleanupOnExit=no

# Lockdown
# If set to enabled, firewall changes with the D-Bus interface will be limited
# to applications that are listed in the lockdown whitelist.
# The lockdown whitelist file is lockdown-whitelist.xml
# Default: no
Lockdown=yes

# IPv6_rpfilter
# Performs a reverse path filter test on a packet for IPv6. If a reply to the
# packet would be sent via the same interface that the packet arrived on, the
# packet will match and be accepted, otherwise dropped.
# The rp_filter for IPv4 is controlled using sysctl.
# Default: yes
IPv6_rpfilter=yes

# IndividualCalls
# Do not use combined -restore calls, but individual calls. This increases the
# time that is needed to apply changes and to start the daemon, but is good for
# debugging.
# Default: no
IndividualCalls=no

# LogDenied
# Add logging rules right before reject and drop rules in the INPUT, FORWARD
# and OUTPUT chains for the default rules and also final reject and drop rules
# in zones. Possible values are: all, unicast, broadcast, multicast and off.
# Default: off
LogDenied=off

# FirewallBackend
# Selects the firewall backend implementation.
# Choices are:
#	- nftables (default)
#	- iptables (iptables, ip6tables, ebtables and ipset)
# nftables tests better for throughput
FirewallBackend=nftables

# FlushAllOnReload
# Flush all runtime rules on a reload. In previous releases some runtime
# configuration was retained during a reload, namely; interface to zone
# assignment, and direct rules. This was confusing to users. To get the old
# behavior set this to "no".
# Default: yes
FlushAllOnReload=yes

# RFC3964_IPv4
# As per RFC 3964, filter IPv6 traffic with 6to4 destination addresses that
# correspond to IPv4 addresses that should not be routed over the public
# internet.
# Defaults to "yes".
RFC3964_IPv4=yes

# AllowZoneDrifting
# Older versions of firewalld had undocumented behavior known as "zone
# drifting". This allowed packets to ingress multiple zones - this is a
# violation of zone based firewalls. However, some users rely on this behavior
# to have a "catch-all" zone, e.g. the default zone. You can enable this if you
# desire such behavior. It's disabled by default for security reasons.
# Note: If "yes" packets will only drift from source based zones to interface
# based zones (including the default zone). Packets never drift from interface
# based zones to other interfaces based zones (including the default zone).
# Possible values; "yes", "no". Defaults to "no".
AllowZoneDrifting=no

# StrictForwardPorts
# If set to yes, the generated destination NAT (DNAT) rules will NOT accept
# traffic that was DNAT'd by other entities, e.g. docker. Firewalld will be
# strict and not allow published container ports until they're explicitly
# allowed via firewalld.
# If set to no, then docker (and podman) integrates seamlessly with firewalld.
# Published container ports are implicitly allowed.
# Defaults to "no".
StrictForwardPorts=yes

# NftablesFlowtable
# This may improve forwarded traffic throughput by enabling nftables flowtable.
# It is a software fastpath and avoids calling nftables rule evaluation for
# data packets. This only works for TCP and UDP traffic.
# The value is a space separated list of interfaces.
# Example value "eth0 eth1".
# Defaults to "off".
NftablesFlowtable={{ wan_iface }} {{ lan_iface }}

# NftablesCounters
# If set to yes, add a counter to every nftables rule. This is useful for
# debugging and comes with a small performance cost.
# Defaults to "no".
NftablesCounters=no

# NftablesTableOwner
# If set to yes, the generated nftables rule set will be owned exclusively by
# firewalld. This prevents other entities from mistakenly (or maliciously)
# modifying firewalld's rule set. If you intentionally modify firewalld's
# rules, then you will have to set this to "no".
# Defaults to "yes".
NftablesTableOwner=yes
